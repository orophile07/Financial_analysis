## 🔍 Why These Statistical Tests?

Before we jump into forecasting the future, we need to understand the past — statistically! 📈  
These foundational tests ensure our time series models stand on solid ground.

---

### 🧪 1. ADF Test — *Stationarity Checker*

> **Use**: Tests whether a time series has a constant mean and variance over time.

**Why it matters**:
Many forecasting models (like ARIMA) require the series to be **stationary**.  
The **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test helps us decide if differencing is needed.

- ✅ **p-value < 0.05**: Data is **stationary** → Good for ARIMA  
- ❌ **p-value ≥ 0.05**: Data is **non-stationary** → Needs differencing

📌 **We used it** to confirm the need for differencing (d=1) in ARIMA/SARIMA.

---

### 🧩 2. Time Series Decomposition — *The Data Dissector*

> **Use**: Breaks a time series into **Trend**, **Seasonality**, and **Noise (Residuals)**.

**Why it matters**:
Understanding the components makes it easier to **build accurate forecasts** and detect **hidden patterns**.

- 📈 **Trend**: Long-term movement  
- 🔁 **Seasonality**: Repeating cycles  
- 🌀 **Residual**: Random noise

📌 **We used it** to visualize structure and support model selection (e.g., SARIMA for seasonal patterns).

---

### 🔁 3. ACF & PACF — *The Lag Investigators*

> **Use**: Help determine how past values relate to the present.

- **ACF (AutoCorrelation Function)**: Measures correlation with past lags  
- **PACF (Partial ACF)**: Shows pure correlation of each lag after removing the effects of previous lags

**Why it matters**:
They're critical for choosing the best ARIMA/SARIMA parameters:
- `p` (from PACF): Auto-regressive lags
- `q` (from ACF): Moving average lags

📌 **We used them** to tune ARIMA → `(p=6, d=1, q=2)`

---

### 🧪 4. Ljung-Box Test — *The Residual Inspector*

> **Use**: Checks if your model’s residuals are just white noise (i.e., random).

**Why it matters**:
After training a model, we want **no patterns left** in residuals.  
The Ljung-Box test tells us whether autocorrelation is present in the residuals.

- ✅ **p-value ≥ 0.05**: Residuals are random → Model is good  
- ❌ **p-value < 0.05**: Residuals have structure → Model needs improvement

📌 **We used it** to validate ARIMA, SARIMA, and GARCH models.

| Test           | Purpose                            | Why It’s Used                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ADF Test       | Check for stationarity              | Prepares data for ARIMA by verifying stationarity   |
| Decomposition  | Break into trend/seasonal/noise     | Helps choose appropriate forecasting strategy       |
| ACF / PACF     | Detect autocorrelation at lags      | Select `p` and `q` for ARIMA/SARIMA                 |
| Ljung-Box Test | Check model residual randomness     | Ensures no leftover patterns after modeling         |
